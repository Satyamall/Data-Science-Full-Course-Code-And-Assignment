Welcome to Python 101 for Data Science! In this course we’re going to cover the

1
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,920
fundamental topics of the Python programming language.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,120
After completing all four modules, you’ll be able to start writing your very own Python

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,380
programs. Based on recent surveys, Python was and still

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,070
is the MOST popular, high-level, open-source programming language!

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,289
It is a powerful, fast and dynamic programming language that runs everywhere.

6
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,530
It’s also interactive, object-oriented, and very easy to learn.

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,960
Anyone can create programs with it. It’s particularly great for web development,

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,920
and scientific computing. With its vast libraries, it’s also useful for data visualization

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,489
and data analytics. This course covers Python 3 and its many new

10
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:54,399
features. It is comprised of four modules. We'll start off with Python basics, writing

11
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,600
your first program, and then cover, in detail, types, expressions, variables, strings and

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,740
string operations. In the 2nd module we'll introduce you to Python

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,110
data structures, namely lists and tuples, sets and dictionaries.

14
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,931
Lists and tuples, are called compound data types and are one of the key types of data

15
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:21,870
structures in Python. Sets and dictionaries are types of collections.

16
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:28,810
In the 3rd module we'll cover Python programming fundamentals, including conditions, branching,

17
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:35,100
loops, functions, and objects and classes. Specifically, you’ll learn about comparison

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,340
and logic operators, and the if, else, and elif statements, for and while loops, how

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,531
to use some of Python’s built-in functions, as well as how build your own functions, and

20
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:51,421
how to create objects and classes using object constructors and attributes.

21
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:57,640
And finally, in the 4th module we'll show you how to work with data in Python.

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,430
Specifically, how to read and write with the open method, and how to load, work with, and

23
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,240
save data in pandas. The hands-on labs after each module will have

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,531
you practice what you learn, using Jupyter notebooks on Cognitive Class.ai Labs.

25
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:18,569
There’s a lot to go over but by practicing all these concepts you’ll be well on your

26
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,379
way to using Python in your own applications. We’re sure you’ll be up and running with

27
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:27,209
Python in no time! So, adjust your headphones and let’s get

28
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:27,719
started!
